# Artemis Financial Secure Software Reports
Within this repository, I have included artifacts from my work with Artemis Financial, showcasing my ability to conduct thorough vulnerability assessments and adhere to secure coding practices.

# Client Summary
Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that sought to modernize its operations with a strong emphasis on software security. My role was to refactor their existing software application to enhance security protocols, specifically by adding a file verification step and employing up-to-date encryption methods.

# Software Security Significance
During this project, I identified the client's software security vulnerabilities and addressed them effectively. One of my notable achievements was the implementation of AES encryption and SHA-256 checksum for data integrity. Secure coding is paramount as it protects against data breaches and maintains the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, which is especially critical in the financial sector.

# Reflecting on the Vulnerability Assessment
The vulnerability assessment was both challenging and informative. The process of using OWASP Dependency-Check revealed several pre-existing vulnerabilities that emphasized the need for regular updates and security reviews. This was an excellent learning opportunity to understand the importance of maintaining dependencies and the implications of neglecting them.

# Increasing Security Layers
To enhance security, I updated the application to enforce HTTPS communication and generated a self-signed certificate for SSL/TLS protocols. The future assessments would benefit from regular scans with tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and incorporating automated security testing within the CI/CD pipeline.

# Ensuring Functional and Secure Code
Post-refactoring, I ensured the functionality and security of the application by conducting both static code analysis and dynamic testing. No new vulnerabilities were introduced, as verified by re-running the dependency check tool.

Resources and Tools
# Throughout this project, I utilized various resources and tools that I believe will be beneficial in future assignments. These included:

Spring Security for implementing secure communications.
Java Keytool for certificate management.
OWASP Dependency-Check for identifying security vulnerabilities.

# Showcasing to Future Employers
For potential employers, I can showcase the completed Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report and the Practices for Secure Software Report. These documents exemplify my hands-on experience in addressing real-world software security challenges.
